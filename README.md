# M4L.RhythmVAE
Max for Live(M4L) Rhythm generator using Variational Autoencoder(VAE) 


## Help me!!

I need your feedback! It takes a few minutes and it's anonymous.

## How it works

[![M4L.RhythmVAE - VAE Rhythm Generator for Max for Live/Ableton Live](./images/youtube_video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7mEumq9wQ "M4L.RhythmVAE - VAE Rhythm Generator for Max for Live/Ableton Live")

If you want to quickly test the device, please use the one in `/release` directory.

If you want to know the detail of the plugin, please refer to my [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01525):

## Requirement
- On Mac: **Ableton Live Suite for Mac 10.1.2** or later
- On Windows: Ableton Live Suite for Windows 10.1.2 **and Standalone Max 8.1.2 or later**  
On Windows, you need to set the path of external standalone Max installation on the preference panel of Ableton Live. The device is not compatible with the internal Max runtime.

## Installation

If you want to edit Max patches and export the device by yourself:

- Open `M4L.RhythmVAE/M4L.RhythmVAE.maxproj`, then open `rhythmvae.maxpat` from the project.
- When you open `rhythmvae.maxpat` for the first time, you need to press `script npm install` to install Node.js packages. 
- Every time you export the device, you have to set `Max for Live Device Type` to `MIDI` on Project Inspector (Apparently this is a bug of Max/MSP.)

## Pretrained model
- You don't have enough training MIDI data? Don't worry! You can find a pretrained model trained with thausands of electronic dance music rhythm patterns in `/release/models`. 

## Known problems
- Incompatible with folders with names containing special characters such as `[]?*!|@`
- Changes you make on the sequence grid view are not reflected the rhythm sequence. It is just a display! 


## TO DO
- better documentation
- better UI design!!
- add a feature to add random noise to `z` 


## Updates
- 2020.3 added | new plugin design by Naoki Ise
- 2019.12.27 fxied| onset/velocity/offset training data used be shuffled independently. it makes no sense! 
- 2019.11.10 added| Time shift parameter / MIDI Mapping
- 2019.10.19 fixed| beat sync issue
- 2019.10.18 added| note on the requirement
- 2019.9.14 added| functionality to save/load trained model 
- 2019.5.21 added| a pretrained model
- 2019.3.11 added| Windows version!

## MIDI Mapping

This devices considers the following 9 drum types:

  | Drum Types |
  |:-----:|
  | Kick  |
  | Snare |
  |Hi-hat closed |
  |Hi-hat open |
  |Tom low|
  |Tom mid|
  |Tom high|
  |Clap|
  |Rim|

MIDI notes in a MIDI file will be classified into the 9 Drum Types based on [General MIDI (GM) Mapping](https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/gm-level-1-sound-set). We have two MIDI Mapping modes and you can select one of these mappings on the device:
